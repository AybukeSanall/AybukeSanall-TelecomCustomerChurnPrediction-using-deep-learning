# Telecom Customer Churn Prediction using Deep Learning

This project aims to develop a deep learning model to predict customer churn in the telecom sector.


## Methods and Steps Used

**Data Preprocessing:** Data loading, removal of unnecessary columns, data transformations, and scaling operations have been performed.

**Model Creation:** A 3-layer artificial neural network model was used to predict customer churn.

**Performance Evaluation:** The model's performance was measured using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

  
## Results
The accuracy of the model is **85.67%.**
It was observed that customer churn was highest in the first 10 months, followed by an increase in customer loyalty.
